Help page for PostgreSQL in container
=====================================

General documentation for PostgreSQL container usage.  Most of this
documentation describes only proof-of-concept implemented ideas.  Be careful not
to rely described API too much because it is still expected to change very fast.

Note that this is for 1.0.1 API
(MAJOR.MINOR.FIX).  Any change in MAJOR part of version introduces backward
incompatibility (you should take into account that interchanging MAJOR container
with MAJOR+N container will need some manual changes in your tooling).  On the
other hand, incrementing MINOR version just adds some new features.


Basic concepts
--------------
We try to push you to mount PostgreSQL datadir from host machine (see
'assert_external_data' option below).

While starting PostgreSQL in container, your database datadir will be
initialized automatically (unless you provided already initialized volume).
That way we allowed you to do 'initdb && start' of the container PostgreSQL
server by one command.

Note that PostgreSQL in container uses /var/lib/pgsql/data/data directory, thus
*not* the direct /var/lib/pgsql/data bind-mount-point.  Changing this location
is not yet supported use-case.

We also try to avoid starting concurrent servers running against the same
datadir volume, see the 'clear_pgdata_pidfile' option.


Basic usage
-----------

We suppose that your $UID is able to communicate with docker's socket file, if
this is not truth -- some of the following actions will need 'sudo' (root
privileges):

  1. Create *persistent* directory where PostgreSQL server should store
     its data (you should make sure to have this properly backed up).

     $ mkdir data

  2. Allow 'postgres' (from container) user writing into this directory:

     $ setfacl -m 'u:26:-wx' data

  3. Run the container (if you are running SELinux on your Docker host machine,
     make sure the :Z suffix is added to the volume):

     $ docker run -d --name postgresql_test \
            -v "$(pwd)/data:/var/lib/pgsql/data:Z" fedora/postgresql
     1f8d36e192421c02d59baba7082adf13f975c35ba42e235e349574a0c049ed43

  4. Connect to the running container from host (obtain psql console):

     $ docker exec -ti postgresql_test /bin/sh
     bash-4.3$ psql -q
     postgres=#

  5. Having 'pgsql' installed on your host machine allows you to connect
     to PostgreSQL server also without the 'docker exec' command:


     $ docker inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' \
            postgresql_test

     172.17.1.189
     $ psql -h 172.17.1.189
     Password:

     You can see that you are able to connect!  But there is no default
     user/password/db (nor even admin password) available at this time.  How to
     setup this, see the 'Advanced usage' documentation.


Advanced usage
--------------

To keep this starting document rather shorter, we moved the rest of
documentation into:

$ docker run --rm fedora/postgresql container-help --component postgresql \
    --topic advanced
