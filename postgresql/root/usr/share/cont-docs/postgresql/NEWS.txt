New in 1.0.1

* dnf reinstall fails if the package has been updated in the meantime,
  fix by s/dnf reinstall/dnf update && dnf reinstall'

New in 1.O.0

* Backward incompatibilities (against pre-release versions):

  - we do not store PG data under /var/lib/pgsql/data, but rather under
    /var/lib/pgsql/data/data.  Users are still expected to bind-mount
    data directory into /var/lib/pgsql/data but must expect sub-directory
    will appear there.

* New features:

  - really basic atomic support added
